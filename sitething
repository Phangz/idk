        <h1>Why I made this website:</h1>
          <br/>
          <p>Because I can, deal with it.</p>
          <h2>Things I like:</h2>
	    <p>Playing games and not socializing</p>
	     <h2>BTW this website is shit I just did this for school and stuff</h2>

            <p>Holy fuck I didn't think you'd actually put that in<p>
            <p>also if you'd want I could probably teach you how to put in new sections of the site<p>
